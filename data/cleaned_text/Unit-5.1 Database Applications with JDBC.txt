Database Applications with JDBC Layout
The current version of JDBC is 4.3. It is the stable release since
21st September, 2017. It is based on the X/Open SQL Call
Level Interface. The java.sql package contains classes and
interfaces for JDBC API.

Connecting to a database by using a JDBC driver
JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect
and execute the query with the database. It is a part of JavaSE (Java
Standard Edition).
JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database. There are four
types of JDBC drivers:
1. JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
2. Native Driver
3. Network Protocol Driver
4. Thin Driver
We have discussed the above four drivers in the next chapter.
We can use JDBC API to access tabular data stored in any relational
database.
By the help of JDBC API, we can save, update, delete and fetch data from
the database. It is like Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) provided by
Microsoft.

Database Applications with JDBC
Why Should We Use JDBC
Before JDBC, ODBC API was the database API to connect and execute the
query with the database. But, ODBC API uses ODBC driver which is written
in C language (i.e. platform dependent and unsecured). That is why Java has
defined its own API (JDBC API) that uses JDBC drivers (written in Java
language).
We can use JDBC API to handle database using Java program and can
perform the following activities:
1. Connect to the database
2. Execute queries and update statements to the database
3. Retrieve the result received from the database.

JDBC connection to Microsoft Access
JDBC connection using JDBC to a Microsoft Access database. This
connection is made with the help of a JdbcOdbc driver. You need to use the
following steps for making a connection to the database.
Creating a Database
Step 1: Open Microsoft Access and select Blank database option and give
the database name as File name option

JDBC connection to Microsoft Access
Step 2: Create a table and insert your data into the table

Now Creating DSN of your database
Step 3: Open your Control Panel and then select Administrative Tools.
Step 4 : Click on Data Source(ODBC)-->System DSN.

Step 5: Now click on add option for making a new DSN.select Microsoft
Access Driver (*.mdb. *.accdb) and then click on Finish

Step 6: Make your desired Data Source Name and then click on
the Select option, for example in this article we use the name mydsn

Step 7 Now you select your data source file for storing it and then
click ok and then click on Create and Finish

Step 8: Java program code
import java.sql.*; import sun.jdbc.odbc.*;
class exjdbc
{ String name;
String rollno,m1,m2;
void listDetails() throws SQLException
{ try { Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver"); }
catch(ClassNotFoundException e) { };
Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:odbc:gk");
Statement st=con.createStatement();
String str="INSERT INTO STUD VALUES('"+name+"','"+rollno+"',"+m1+","+m2+");";
ResultSet rs=st.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM gk");
System.out.println(" NAME ROLLNO M1 M2 ");
System.out.println("--------------------------");
while(rs.next())
{ name=rs.getString(1); rollno=rs.getString(2); m1=rs.getString(3);
m2=rs.getString(4); System.out.println(name+"\t"+rollno+"\t"+m1+"\t"+m2);
} }

public static void main(String a[])
{
exjdbc e1=new exjdbc();
try
{
e1.listDetails();
}
catch(SQLException e2)
{
System.out.println(e2);
}
}
}

JDBC Driver
JDBC Driver is a software component that enables java
application to interact with the database.
There are 4 types of JDBC drivers:
1. JDBC-ODBC bridge driver
2. Native-API driver (partially java driver)
3. Network Protocol driver (fully java driver)
4. Thin driver (fully java driver)
15
[PAGE 16]
JDBC Driver
1) JDBC-ODBC bridge driver
The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver uses ODBC driver to connect to the database.
The JDBC-ODBC bridge driver converts JDBC method calls into the ODBC
function calls. This is now discouraged because of thin driver.
16
[PAGE 17]
JDBC Driver
Oracle does not support the JDBC-ODBC Bridge from Java 8. Oracle
recommends that you use JDBC drivers provided by the vendor of your
database instead of the JDBC-ODBC Bridge.
Advantages:
Easy to use.
can be easily connected to any database.
Disadvantages:
Performance degraded because JDBC method call is converted into the
ODBC function calls.
The ODBC driver needs to be installed on the client machine.
17
[PAGE 18]
JDBC Driver
2) Native-API driver
The Native API driver uses the client-side libraries of the database. The
driver converts JDBC method calls into native calls of the database API. It is
not written entirely in java.
18

JDBC Driver
2) Native-API driver
Advantage:
performance upgraded than JDBC-ODBC bridge driver.
Disadvantage:
The Native driver needs to be installed on the each client machine.
The Vendor client library needs to be installed on client machine.

JDBC Driver
3) Network Protocol driver
The Network Protocol driver uses middleware (application server) that
converts JDBC calls directly or indirectly into the vendor-specific database
protocol. It is fully written in java.
20
[PAGE 21]
JDBC Driver
3) Network Protocol driver
Advantage:
No client side library is required because of application server that can
perform many tasks like auditing, load balancing, logging etc.
Disadvantages:
Network support is required on client machine.
Requires database-specific coding to be done in the middle tier.
Maintenance of Network Protocol driver becomes costly because it requires
database-specific coding to be done in the middle tier.

4) Thin driver
The thin driver converts JDBC calls directly into the vendor-specific database
protocol. That is why it is known as thin driver. It is fully written in Java
language.

JDBC Driver
4) Thin driver
The thin driver converts JDBC calls directly into the vendor-specific database
protocol. That is why it is known as thin driver. It is fully written in Java
language.
Advantage:
Better performance than all
other drivers.
No software is required at client
side or server side.
Disadvantage:
Drivers depend on the
Database.
