this keyword
In Java, this is a reference variable that refers to the current object.
Usages of Java this keywor
1. this can be used to refer current class instance variable.
2. this can be used to invoke current class method (implicitly)
3. this() can be used to invoke current class constructor.
4. this can be passed as an argument in the method call.
5. this can be passed as argument in the constructor call.
6. this can be used to return the current class instance from the method.

Refer Current Class Instance Variable
Resolve the problem of Ambiguity between the instance
variables and parameters (local variables).
class Student{
int rollno;
String name;
float fee;
Student(int rollno, String name, float fee)
{
rollno=rollno;
name=name;
fee=fee;
}
void display()
{ System.out.println(rollno+" "+name+" "+fee);} }
[PAGE 5]
Refer Current Class Instance Variable
class TestStudent{
public static void main(String args[]){
Student s1=new Student(111,"ankit",5000f);
Student s2=new Student(112,"sumit",6000f);
s1.display();
s2.display();
}}
The execution result due to ambiquity is:
0 null 0.0
0 null 0.0
To resolve the ambiquity, use this keyword in
this.rollno = rollno;
this.name = name;
this.fee = fee;
[PAGE 6]
Invoke the Current Class Method
Suppose if the programmer not provide the this keyword to access the
current class method, Java compiler add “this” keyword automatically.
class ArithmeticOperations {
void addition() { }
void subtraction () { }
addition(); // compiler convert this.addition();
}
public static void main(String[] a) {
new ArithmeticOperations().subtraction();
[PAGE 7]
Invoke the Current Class Constructor
Current class constructor to be invoked and reused by this keyword.
Calling default constructor from parameterized constructor
class Calculate {
Calculate c= new Calculate(5,5);
Calculate()
{
System.out.println(“Hello World”);
}
Calculate(int x, int y)
{ this();
System.out.println(x*y);
}}
[PAGE 8]
Invoke the Current Class Constructor
Calling parameterized constructor from default constructor
class Calculate {
Calculate()
{
Calculate c= new Calculate();
this(5,5);
System.out.println(“Hello World”);
}
Calculate(int x, int y)
{
System.out.println(x*y);
}}

2. final Keyword
[PAGE 10]
JAVA final Keyword
The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user. The java final keyword can be
used in many context. Final can be:
variable
method
class
The final keyword can be applied with the variables, a final variable that have no
value it is called blank final variable or uninitialized final variable. It can be
initialized in the constructor only. The blank final variable can be static also which
will be initialized in the static block only. We will have detailed learning of these.
Let's first learn the basics of final keyword.
1) Java final variable
If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable(It
will be constant).
Example of final variable
There is a final variable speedlimit, we are going to change the value of this
variable, but It can't be changed because final variable once assigned a value can
never be changed.
[PAGE 11]
JAVA final Keyword contd...
Final Variable:
class Bike9{
final int speedlimit=90;//final variable
void run(){
speedlimit=400;
}
public static void main(String args[]){
Bike9 obj=new Bike9();
obj.run();
}
}//end of class
Output: Compile Time Error
[PAGE 12]
JAVA final Keyword contd...
Final Method:
If you make any method as final, you cannot override it.
class Bike{
final void run(){System.out.println("running");}
}
class Honda extends Bike{
void run(){System.out.println("Running safely with 100kmph");}
public static void main(String args[]){
Honda honda= new Honda();
honda.run();
}
Output: Compile Time Error
}
[PAGE 13]
JAVA final Keyword contd...
Final Class:
If you make any class as final, you cannot extend it.
final class Bike
{
}
class Honda extends Bike{
void run(){System.out.println("Running safely with 100kmph");}
public static void main(String args[]){
Honda honda= new Honda();
honda.run();
}
Output: Compile Time Error
}
[PAGE 14]
Where to apply final Keyword?
Q) What is blank or uninitialized final variable?
A final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known as blank
final variable.
If you want to create a variable that is initialized at the time of creating object and
once initialized may not be changed, it is useful. For example PAN CARD number of
an employee.
It can be initialized only in constructor.
Example of blank final variable
class Student
{
int id;
String name;
final String PAN_CARD_NUMBER;
...
}
[PAGE 15]
Where to apply final Keyword?
Que) Can we initialize blank final variable?
Yes, but only in constructor.
class Bike10{
final int speedlimit; //blank final variable
Bike10(){
speedlimit=70;
System.out.println(speedlimit);
}
public static void main(String args[]){
new Bike10();
}
}
[PAGE 16]
Where to apply final Keyword?
static blank final variable
A static final variable that is not initialized at the time of declaration is known
as static blank final variable. It can be initialized only in static block.
Example of static blank final variable
class A
{
static final int data; //static blank final variable
static
{ data=50;}
public static void main(String args[])
{
System.out.println(A.data);
}
}

3. Recursion
[PAGE 18]
Recursion in JAVA
Recursion in java is a process in which a method calls itself
continuously.
A method in java that calls itself is called recursive method.
It makes the code compact but complex to understand.
Syntax:
returntype methodname(){
method body; //code to be executed
methodname(); //calling same method
}
[PAGE 19]
Recursion in JAVA – Infinite Times
public class RecursionInfinite
{
static void test()
{
System.out.println("Hello World");
test();
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
test();
}
}
[PAGE 20]
Recursion in JAVA – Finite Times
public class RecursionFinite
{
static int count=0;
static void test()
{
count++;
if(count<=5) {
System.out.println("Hello World" +count);
test();
}
public static void main(String[] args) {
test();
}
}

4. Operator ‘instanceof’
[PAGE 23]
JAVA ‘instanceof’ Operator
The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance
of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).
The ‘instanceof’ in java is also known as type comparison operator because it
compares the instance with type. It returns either true or false. If we apply the
instanceof operator with any variable that has null value, it returns false.
Simple example of java instanceof
Let's see the simple example of instance operator where it tests the current class.
class Simple1{
public static void main(String args[])
{
Simple1 s=new Simple1();
System.out.println(s instanceof Simple1); //true
} }
[PAGE 24]
JAVA ‘instanceof’ Operator
An object of subclass type is also a type of parent class. For example, if Dog
extends Animal then object of Dog can be referred by either Dog or Animal
class.
Another example of java instanceof operator
class Animal{}
class Dog1 extends Animal{//Dog inherits Animal
public static void main(String args[]){
Dog1 d=new Dog1();
System.out.println(d instanceof Animal);//true
}
}
[PAGE 25]
JAVA ‘instanceof’ Operator
instanceof in java with a variable that have null value
If we apply instanceof operator with a variable that have null value, it
returns false.
class Dog2{
public static void main(String args[]){
Dog2 d=null;
System.out.println(d instanceof Dog2); //false
}
}

5. enum class
[PAGE 27]
JAVA enum class
The enum in Java is a data type which contains a fixed set of constants.
It can be used for days of the week (SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
THURSDAY, FRIDAY, and SATURDAY) , directions (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, and
WEST), season (SPRING, SUMMER, WINTER, and AUTUMN or FALL), colors (RED,
YELLOW, BLUE, GREEN, WHITE, and BLACK) etc. According to the Java naming
conventions, we should have all constants in capital letters. So, we have enum
constants in capital letters.
Java enums can be thought of as classes which have a fixed set of constants (a
variable that does not change).
The Java enum constants are static and final implicitly. It is available since JDK
1.5.
Enums are used to create our own data type like classes. The enum data type
(also known as Enumerated Data Type) is used to define an enum in Java. Unlike
C/C++, enum in Java is more powerful. Here, we can define an enum either inside
the class or outside the class.
[PAGE 28]
JAVA enum class
Java Enum internally inherits the Enum class, so it cannot inherit any other
class, but it can implement many interfaces. We can have fields, constructors,
methods, and main methods in Java enum.
Points to remember for Java Enum
Enum improves type safety
Enum can be easily used in switch
Enum can be traversed
Enum can have fields, constructors and methods
Enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it
internally extends Enum class
[PAGE 29]
JAVA enum class
Simple Example of Java Enum
class EnumExample1{
//defining the enum inside the class
public enum Season { WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL }
//main method
public static void main(String[] args) {
//traversing the enum
for (Season s : Season.values())
System.out.println(s);
}}
[PAGE 30]
JAVA enum class
Java Enum Example: Defined inside class
class EnumExample2{
enum Season { WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL; }
//semicolon(;) is optional here
public static void main(String[] args) {
Season s=Season.WINTER;
//enum type is required to access WINTER
System.out.println(s);
}}
