Java Class and Objects
An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a
class in Java is a logical entity only.
What is an object in Java?
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair,
bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible
and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the banking
system.
[PAGE 5]
Java Class and Objects
An object has three characteristics:
State: represents the data (value) of an object.
Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as
deposit, withdraw, etc.
Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID.
The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. However, it is
used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.
[PAGE 6]
Java Class and Objects
[PAGE 7]
Java Class and Objects
For Example, Pen is an object. Its name is Reynolds; color is
white, known as its state. It is used to write, so writing is its
behavior.
An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template or
blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is the
instance(result) of a class.
Object Definitions:
An object is a real-world entity.
An object is a runtime entity.
The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
The object is an instance of a class.
[PAGE 8]
Java Class and Objects
What is a class in Java
A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It
is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a
logical entity. It can't be physical.
A class in Java can contain:
Fields
Methods
Constructors
Blocks
Nested class and interface
Syntax to declare a class:
class <class_name>
{
field;
method;
}
[PAGE 9]
Java Class and Objects
Instance variable in Java
A variable which is created inside the class but outside the
method is known as an instance variable. Instance variable
doesn't get memory at compile time. It gets memory at runtime
when an object or instance is created. That is why it is known as
an instance variable.
new keyword in Java
The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime.
All objects get memory in Heap memory area.
Method in Java
In Java, a method is like a function which is used to expose the
behavior of an object.
Advantage of Method
Code Reusability and Code Optimization
[PAGE 10]
Java Class and Objects
Object and Class Example: main within the class
created a Student class which has two data members id and name. We
are creating the object of the Student class by new keyword and printing
the object's value. Here, we are creating a main() method inside the
class.
File: Student.java
class Student{ //defining fields Output:
int id; //field or data member or instance variable 0
String name; null
//creating main method inside the Student class
public static void main(String args[]){
//Creating an object or instance
Student s1=new Student();//creating an object of Student
//Printing values of the object
System.out.println(s1.id);//accessing member through reference variable
System.out.println(s1.name); } }
[PAGE 11]
Java Class and Objects
Object and Class Example: main outside the class
In real time development, we create classes and use it from
another class. It is a better approach than previous one.
Let's see a simple example, where we are having main() method
in another class.
We can have multiple classes in different Java files or single
Java file. If you define multiple classes in a single Java source
file, it is a good idea to save the file name with the class name
which has main() method.

3 Ways to initialize object
There are 3 ways to initialize object in Java.
1. By reference variable
2. By method
3. By constructor
[PAGE 13]
Java Class and Objects
1) Object and Class Example: Initialization through reference
Initializing an object means storing data into the object. Let's see a simple
example where we are going to initialize the object through a reference
variable.
File: TestStudent2.java
class Student{
int id;
String name;
}
class TestStudent2{
public static void main(String args[]){
Student s1=new Student();
s1.id=10021;
s1.name="SakthiSharma";
System.out.println(s1.id+" "+s1.name);//printing members with a white space
} }
[PAGE 14]
Java Class and Objects
We can also create multiple objects and store information in it through
reference variable.
//Printing data
File: TestStudent3.java
System.out.println(s1.id+" "+s1.name);
class Student{
System.out.println(s2.id+" "+s2.name);
int id;
}
String name;
}
}
class TestStudent3{
public static void main(String args[]){
//Creating objects
Student s1=new Student();
Output:
Student s2=new Student();
101 Sonoo
//Initializing objects
102 Amit
s1.id=101;
s1.name="Sonoo";
s2.id=102;
s2.name="Amit";
[PAGE 15]
Java Class and Objects
2) Object and Class Example: Initialization through method
In this example, we are creating the two objects of Student
class and initializing the value to these objects by invoking the
insertRecord method. Here, we are displaying the state (data)
of the objects by invoking the displayInformation() method.
[PAGE 16]
Java Class and Objects
File: TestStudent4.java
class Student{
int rollno;
String name;
void insertRecord(int r, String n){
rollno=r;
name=n; }
void displayInformation() {System.out.println(rollno+" "+name);} }
class TestStudent4{
public static void main(String args[]){
Student s1=new Student(); Output:
Student s2=new Student();
111 Karan
s1.insertRecord(111,"Karan");
222 Aryan
s2.insertRecord(222,"Aryan");
s1.displayInformation();
s2.displayInformation();
} }
[PAGE 17]
Java Class and Objects
Object gets the memory in heap memory area. The reference
variable refers to the object allocated in the heap memory area.
Here, s1 and s2 both are reference variables that refer to the
objects allocated in memory.
[PAGE 18]
Java Class and Objects
3) Object and Class Example: Initialization through a
constructor
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to
initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a
class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object
attributes
[PAGE 19]
Java Class and Objects
Object and Class Example: Employee
public class TestEmployee {
File: TestEmployee.java
public static void main(String[] args) {
class Employee{ Employee e1=new Employee();
Employee e2=new Employee();
int id;
Employee e3=new Employee();
String name;
e1.insert(101,"ajeet",45000);
float salary;
e2.insert(102,"irfan",25000);
void insert(int i, String n, float s)
e3.insert(103,"nakul",55000);
{
e1.display();
Output:
id=i; e2.display();
101 ajeet 45000.0
e3.display();
name=n;
} 102 irfan 25000.0
salary=s;
}
103 nakul 55000.0
}
void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name+" "+salary);}
}
[PAGE 20]
Java Class and Objects
Object and Class Example: Rectangle
File: TestRectangle1.java
class TestRectangle1{
public static void main(String args[]){
Rectangle r1=new Rectangle();
Rectangle r2=new Rectangle();
class Rectangle{
r1.insert(11,5);
int length; r2.insert(3,15);
r1.calculateArea();
int width;
r2.calculateArea();
void insert(int l, int w){
Output:
}
length=l;
55
}
width=w;
45
}
void calculateArea()
{System.out.println(length*width);}
}

Java method
In general, a method is a way to perform some task. Similarly,
the method in Java is a collection of instructions that performs a
specific task. It provides the reusability of code. We can also easily
modify code using methods. In this section, we will learn what is a
method in Java, types of methods, method declaration, and how to
call a method in Java.
What is a method in Java?
A method is a block of code or collection of statements or a set of
code grouped together to perform a certain task or operation. It is
used to achieve the reusability of code. We write a method once and
use it many times. We do not require to write code again and again. It
also provides the easy modification and readability of code, just by
adding or removing a chunk of code. The method is executed only
when we call or invoke it.
The most important method in Java is the main() method. If you want
to read more about the main() method.
[PAGE 22]
Java method
Method Declaration
The method declaration provides information about method attributes, such
as visibility, return-type, name, and arguments. It has six components that
are known as method header, as we have shown in the following figure.
[PAGE 23]
Java method
Method Signature: Every method has a method signature. It is a part of
the method declaration. It includes the method name and parameter
list.
Access Specifier: Access specifier or modifier is the access type of the
method. It specifies the visibility of the method. Java provides four types
of access specifier:
Public: The method is accessible by all classes when we use public
specifier in our application.
Private: When we use a private access specifier, the method is accessible
only in the classes in which it is defined.
Protected: When we use protected access specifier, the method is
accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package.
Default: When we do not use any access specifier in the method
declaration, Java uses default access specifier by default. It is visible only
from the same package only.
[PAGE 24]
Java method
Return Type: Return type is a data type that the method returns. It may
have a primitive data type, object, collection, void, etc. If the method
does not return anything, we use void keyword.
Method Name: It is a unique name that is used to define the name of a
method. It must be corresponding to the functionality of the method.
Suppose, if we are creating a method for subtraction of two numbers,
the method name must be subtraction(). A method is invoked by its
name.
Parameter List: It is the list of parameters separated by a comma and
enclosed in the pair of parentheses. It contains the data type and
variable name. If the method has no parameter, left the parentheses
blank.
Method Body: It is a part of the method declaration. It contains all the
actions to be performed. It is enclosed within the pair of curly braces.
[PAGE 25]
Java method
Naming a Method
While defining a method, remember that the method name must be
a verb that start with a lowercase letter and combine with Noun and its
first letter is a uppercase as like class name.
The method has more than two words, the first method name followed
by adjective noun.
For example:
Single-word method name:
sumData()
findArea()
Multi-word method name:
sumOfData()
findAreaOfCircle()
It is also possible that a method has the same name as another method name in the same
class, it is known as method overloading.
[PAGE 26]
Java method
Types of Method
There are two types of methods in Java:
Predefined Method
User-defined Method
Predefined Method
In Java, predefined methods are the method that is already defined in the Java
class libraries is known as predefined methods. It is also known as the standard
library method or built-in method.
We can directly use these methods just by calling them in the program at any
point.
Example: length(), equals(), compareTo(), sqrt(), etc.
When we call any of the predefined methods in our program, a series of codes
related to the corresponding method runs in the background that is already
stored in the library.
[PAGE 27]
Java method
Each and every predefined method is defined inside a class. Such
as print() method is defined in the java.io.PrintStream class. It prints the
statement that we write inside the method. For example, print("Java"), it
prints Java on the console.
Let's see an example of the predefined method.
Maximum.java
public class Maximum
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
// using the max() method of Math class
Math.max(9,7));
System.out.print("The maximum number is: " +
}
}
Output:
The maximum number is: 9
[PAGE 28]
Java method
User-defined Method
The method written by the user or programmer is known as a
user-defined method. These methods are modified according to the
requirement.
How to Create a User-defined Method
Let's create a user defined method that checks the number is even or odd.
First, we will define the method.
//user defined method
findEvenOdd(int num)
public static void
{
//method body
if(num%2==0)
System.out.println(num+" is even");
else
System.out.println(num+" is odd");
}
[PAGE 29]
Java method
How to Call or Invoke a User-defined Method
Once we have defined a method, it should be called. The calling of a method
in a program is simple. When we call or invoke a user-defined method, the
program control transfer to the called method.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class EvenOdd // file name is EvenOdd.java
{
public static void main (String args[])
{
//creating Scanner class object
Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter the number: ");
//reading value from the user
int num=scan.nextInt();
//method calling
findEvenOdd(sum);
}
[PAGE 30]
Java method
Let's combine both snippets of codes in a single program and execute it.
EvenOdd.java
//user defined method
import java.util.Scanner;
public static void findEvenOdd(int num)
public class EvenOdd
{
{
//method body
public static void main (String args[])
if(num%2==0)
{ System.out.println(num+" is even");
else
//creating Scanner class object
System.out.println(num+" is odd");
Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
}
System.out.print("Enter the number: ");
}
//reading value from user
int num=scan.nextInt();
//method calling
findEvenOdd(num);
} Output:
Enter the number: 12
12 is even
[PAGE 31]
Java method
Addition.java
public class Addition
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
int a = 19;
//user defined method
int b = 5;
public static int add(int n1, int n2)
//method calling
//n1 and n2 are formal parameters
int c = add(a, b); //a and b are actual parameters
{
System.out.println("Thientsus;m of a and b is= " + c);
} s=n1+n2;
return s; //returning the sum
}
}
Output:
The sum of a and b is= 24
[PAGE 32]
Java method
Static Method
A method that has static keyword is known as static method. In other words,
a method that belongs to a class rather than an instance of a class is known
as a static method. We can also create a static method by using the
keyword static before the method name.
The main advantage of a static method is that we can call it without
creating an object.
It can access static data members and also change the value of it. It is used
to create an instance method. It is invoked by using the class name. The best
example of a static method is the main() method.
[PAGE 33]
Java method
Example of static method
Display.java
public class Display
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
show();
}
static void show()
{
System.out.println("It is an example of static method.");
}
}
Output:
It is an example of a static method.
[PAGE 34]
What do you understand?
[PAGE 35]
Constructors
In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method.
It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling
constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.
Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor
is called.
It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In
such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.
There are two types of constructors in Java:
No-argument constructor, and parameterized constructor.
Note: It is called constructor because it constructs the values at the time of
object creation. It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. It is because
java compiler creates a default constructor if your class doesn't have any.
[PAGE 36]
Constructors
Rules for creating Java constructor
There are two rules defined for the constructor.
Constructor name must be the same as its class name
A Constructor must have no explicit return type
A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
Note: We can use access modifiers while declaring a constructor.
It controls the object creation. In other words, we can have private,
protected, public or default constructor in Java.
[PAGE 37]
Constructors
Types of Java constructors
There are two types of constructors in Java:
1. Default constructor (no-argument constructor)
2. Parameterized constructor
In this example, we are creating the no-arg constructor in the Bike class. It will be
invoked at the time of object creation.
Example of default constructor
//Java Program to create and call a default constructor
class Bike1{
//creating a default constructor
Bike1()
{ System.out.println("Bike is created"); }
//main method
Output:
public static void main(String args[]){
Bike is created
//calling a default constructor
Bike1 b=new Bike1();
} }
[PAGE 38]
Constructors
Rule: If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically
creates a default constructor.
What is the purpose of a default constructor?
The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the
object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.
[PAGE 39]
Constructors
Example of default constructor that displays the default values
//Let us see another example of default constructor
//which displays the default values
class Student3{
int id;
String name;
//method to display the value of id and name
void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}
public static void main(String args[]){
//creating objects
Student3 s1=new Student3(); Output:
Student3 s2=new Student3(); 0 null
//displaying values of the object
0 null
s1.display();
s2.display();
}
}
[PAGE 40]
Constructors
Parameterized Constructor
A constructor which has a specific number of parameters is called a
parameterized constructor.
Why use the parameterized constructor?
The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to
distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values also.
Example of parameterized constructor
In this example, we have created the constructor of Student class that
have two parameters. We can have any number of parameters in the
constructor.
[PAGE 41]
Constructors
//Java Program to demonstrate the use of the parameterized constructor.
class Student4{
int id;
String name;
//creating a parameterized constructor
Student4(int i,String n){
id = i;
name = n;
}
Output:
//method to display the values
void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);} 111 Karan
public static void main(String args[]){
222 Aryan
//creating objects and passing values
Student4 s1 = new Student4(111,"Karan");
Student4 s2 = new Student4(222,"Aryan");
//calling method to display the values of object
s1.display();
s2.display();
}
}
[PAGE 42]
// parameterized constructor to initialize the dimensions of a box.
class Box {
double width;
double height;
Output:
double depth;
Volume is 3000.0
Box(double w, double h, double d) {
Volume is 162.0
width = w;
height = h;
depth = d;
}
double volume() // compute and return volume
{ return width * height * depth; } }
class BoxDemo7 {
public static void main(String args[]) {
Box mybox1 = new Box(10, 20, 15);
Box mybox2 = new Box(3, 6, 9);
double vol;
vol = mybox1.volume(); // get volume of first box
System.out.println("Volume is " + vol);
vol = mybox2.volume(); // get volume of second box
System.out.println("Volume is " + vol);
}}
[PAGE 45]
Stack Operation
[PAGE 46]
// This class defines an integer stack that can hold 10 values.
class Stack {
int stck[] = new int[10];
int top; class TestStack {
// Initialize top-of-stack public static void main(String args[])
Stack() { {
top = -1; Stack mystack1 = new Stack();
} Stack mystack2 = new Stack();
// Push an item onto the stack // push some numbers onto the stack
void push(int item) { for(int i=0; i<10; i++) mystack1.push(i);
if(top==9) for(int i=10; i<20; i++) mystack2.push(i);
System.out.println("Stack is full."); // pop those numbers off the stack
else System.out.println("Stack in mystack1:");
stck[++top] = item;} for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
// Pop an item from the stack System.out.println(mystack1.pop());
int pop() { System.out.println("Stack in mystack2:");
if(top < 0) { for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
System.out.println("Stack underflow."); System.out.println(mystack2.pop());
return 0; }
}else }
return stck[top--];
}}

[PAGE 48]
Java Constructor
Java Copy Constructor
There is no copy constructor in Java. However, we can copy the values from
one object to another like copy constructor in C++.
There are many ways to copy the values of one object into another in Java.
They are:
By constructor
By assigning the values of one object into another
By clone() method of Object class
In this example, we are going to copy the values of one object into another
using Java constructor.
[PAGE 49]
Java Constructor
//Java program to initialize the values from one object to another object.
class Student6{
int id;
public static void main(String args[]){
String name; Student6 s1 = new Student6(111,"Karan");
Student6 s2 = new Student6(s1);
//constructor to initialize integer and string
s1.display();
Student6(int i,String n){
s2.display();
id = i;
}
name = n;
}
}
//constructor to initialize another object
Student6(Student6 s){
Output:
id = s.id;
111 Karan
name =s.name;
111 Karan
}
void display(){System.out.println(id+" "+name);}
[PAGE 50]
Java Constructor
Copying values without constructor
We can copy the values of one object into another by assigning the objects
values to another object. In this case, there is no need to create the
constructor.
class Student7{
public static void main(String args[]){
int id;
Student7 s1 = new Student7(111,"Karan");
String name;
Student7 s2 = new Student7();
Student7(int i,String n){
s2.id=s1.id;
id = i; s2.name=s1.name;
name = n; s1.display();
s2.display();
}
}
Student7(){}
}
void display()
{System.out.println(id+" "+name);}
Output:
111 Karan
111 Karan
