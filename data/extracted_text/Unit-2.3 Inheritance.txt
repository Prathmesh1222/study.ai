Introduction
Objectives of the Inheritance:
Identify the relationship.
●
Represent relationships in a Java program.
●
Override methods of the base class.
●
Identify the constraints.
●
Apply the constraints.
●
Using final keywork and Abstract classes.

Introduction
• Inheritance is the process by which one object acquires
the properties of another objects.
• By use of inheritance an object need to define only
qualities that make it unique within class.
• It can inherit its general attributed from its parent.
• It provides code re-usability feature.
• Only single inheritance is allowed among classes.
• All public and protected members of a super class are
accessible in the subclasses.
• All protected members are also accessible within the
package.

[PAGE 5]
Introduction
• Relationships are classified as follows:
• A kind-Of relationship
• An Is-A relationship
• A part-Of relationship
• A Has-A relationship
• For example: Automobile, Ford, Truck, Car, and Engine.
• A truck is a kind of an automobile.
• A car is a kind of an automobile.
• An engine is a part of an automobile.
• An automobile has an engine.
• The Ford is a car.

How to implement?
• Common Procedure
• Step-1: Code the Superclass.
• Step-2: Code the method in the Superclass.
• Step-3: Code the Subclass.
• Step-4: Code the method in the Subclass.
• Step-5: Save the program.
• Step-6: Compile the program.
• Step-7: Execute the program.

[PAGE 7]
How to implement?
• Example: Superclass – Applicant
• Subclass - Candidate
• public class Applicant
{ // Declaring data members
String applicantID;
String applicantName;
String applicantAddress;
String applicantPosition;
// Initializing variables
Applicant ( ) // Constructor without parameter
{ // Initialize the data members of the applicant class.
}
// Rest of the code
}

[PAGE 8]
How to implement?
Code for method in Superclass
public class Applicant()
{
// Code for displaying the details
void ( ) // Super class Method
displayDetails
{
// Code for displaying the attributes
}
// Rest of the code
}

[PAGE 9]
How to implement?
Code for candidate as subclass
public class Candidate extends Applicant
{
// Declaring data members
String interviewDate;
Boolean candidateStatus;
// Initializing variables
Candidate ( ) // Constructor without parameter
{
interviewDate = “04 – June – 2010” ;
candidateStatus = false ;
}
// Rest of the code for candidate class
}

[PAGE 10]
How to implement?
Code the method in subclass
public class Candidate extends Applicant
{
void displayDetails ( )
{
// Call the displayDetails ( ) method of the superclass.
Super . displayDetails ( );
// Code for displaying the attributes of candidate class.
}
// Initializing variables
Candidate ( )
{
// Code for initializing the data members
}
// Rest of the code for candidate class
}

Usage of Inheritance
Reduce redundancy in code: Code redundancy means writing the same code in
different places, leading to unnecessary replication of code. Inheritance helps
us to reuse code.
Maintain code easily, as the code resides at one place (superclass). Any change
made to the superclass automatically changes the behavior of subclass
because the subclasses inherit the new behavior automatically.
Extend the functionality of an existing class by adding more methods to the
subclass.

[PAGE 12]
Points to Remember
The keyword “extends” is used to inherit a subclass from superclass.
A class member that has declared as private will remain private to its class. It is not
accessible by any code outside its class, including subclasses.

[PAGE 13]
2. super Keyword

[PAGE 14]
Introduction
The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer
immediate parent class object.
Whenever you create the instance of subclass, an instance of parent class is
created implicitly i.e. referred by super reference variable.
Usage of java super Keyword
• super is used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
• super() is used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.
• super is used to invoke immediate parent class method.

[PAGE 15]
Introduction
Super has two general forms:
* The first calls the superclass constructor.
* The second is used to access a member of the superclass that has hidden
by a member of a subclass.

[PAGE 16]
Calling Superclass Constructor
A subclass can call a constructor method defined by its superclass by use of the
following form of super:
super(parameter-list);
Here, parameter-list specifies any parameters needed by the constructor in the
superclass. super( ) must always be the first statement executed
inside a subclass’ constructor.

[PAGE 17]
Calling Superclass Member
The second form of super acts somewhat like this keyword,
except that it always refers to the superclass of the subclass in
which it is used.
• General form: super.m
• Here, member can be either a method or instance variable.
• This second form of super is most applicable to situations in
which member names of a subclass hide members by the
same name in the superclass.

[PAGE 18]
JAVA super Keyword
class Vehicle{
int speed=50;
}
class Car extends Vehicle{
int speed=100;
+super.speed
void display(){
System.out.println(“Car Speed:”+speed);
}
public static void main(String args[]){
Car c=new Car();
c.display();
CCaarr SSppeeeedd::15000
}
}

[PAGE 19]
JAVA super Keyword contd...
Classes use constructors to initialize instance
variables
•When a subclass object is created, its constructor is
called.
•It is the responsibility of the subclass constructor to
invoke the appropriate superclass constructors so that
the instance variables defined in the superclass are
properly initialized.
•Superclass constructors can be called using the "super"
keyword in a manner similar to "this“ keyword
•It must be the first line of code in the constructor.
•If a call to super is not made, the system will
automatically attempt to invoke the no-argument
constructor of the superclass.

[PAGE 20]
JAVA super Keyword contd...
// When subclass constructor called.
// Create Superclass Vehicle
class Vehicle {
Vehicle() {
System.out.println(" Vehicle class constructor.");
}}
// Create Car subclass by extending class Vehicle.
class Car extends Vehicle {
Car() {
System.out.println("Car class constructor.");
}}
// Create Ford subclass by extending Car.
class Ford extends Car {
Ford() {
System.out.println("Ford class constructor.");
}}
class CallingCons {
public static void main(String args[]) {
Ford f = new Ford();
}
}

3. Types of Inheritance

[PAGE 22]
Introduction
• Single Inheritance: Only one superclass and subclass.
• Multiple Inheritance: More than one superclass.
• (Java uses interfaces)
• Multilevel Inheritance: One superclass and more than
• one subclasses.
• Hierarchical Inheritance: Derived from a Derived class
• only.

Introduction

[PAGE 26]
Single Inheritance
When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance.
class Animal{
void eat()
{System.out.println("eating...");}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
void bark()
{System.out.println("barking...");}
}
class InheritanceTest{
public static void main(String args[]){
Dog d=new Dog();
d.bark(); // subclass Dog method
d.eat(); // superclass Animal method
}}

[PAGE 27]
Multilevel Inheritance
When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance.
class Animal{
void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}
}
class BabyDog extends Dog{
void weep(){System.out.println("weeping...");}
}
class InheritanceTest{
public static void main(String args[]){
BabyDog d=new BabyDog();
d.weep();
d.bark();
d.eat();
}}

[PAGE 28]
Hierarchical Inheritance
When two or more classes inherits a single class.
class Animal{
void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}
}
class Cat extends Animal{
void meow(){System.out.println("meowing...");}
}
class InheritanceTest{
public static void main(String args[]){
Cat c=new Cat();
c.meow();
c.eat();
c.bark();
// Compile time error
}}

[PAGE 29]
Multiple Inheritance
Java does not support multiple inheritance.
Reason: Dangling References.
Compile Time Error / Run Time Error
Solution: Using interface
Interface:
Interface is a abstract type that the interface name as like class name.
Syntax: <access_specifier> interface <interface_name>
Example: public interface Shapes
{
Circle();
Rectangle();

4. Polymorphism

[PAGE 31]
Introduction
• Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform
a single action in different ways.
• Polymorphism is derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs.
• The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So
polymorphism means many forms.
• There are two types of polymorphism in Java:
1. Compile time polymorphism
2. Run time polymorphism.
• We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and
method overriding.
• If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile
time polymorphism.

[PAGE 32]
Compile Time Polymorphism
• In Java, we can create method that have same name, but different
parameter lists and different definitions.
• This kind of method creation is called Method Overloading.
• Method Overloading Process:
• When objects are required to perform similar tasks but using
different input parameters.
• When call a method, Java compiler matches up the method name
first and then the number and type of parameters to decide which
one of the declarations to execute.

[PAGE 33]
Compile Time Polymorphism cont...
• class Room {
• float length; float breadth;
• Room(float x, float y) // Constructor-1
• {
• length = x;
• breadth = y;
• }
• Room(float x) // Constructor-2
• {
• length = breadth = x;
• }
• int area()
• {
• return(length * breadth);
• }
• }

[PAGE 34]
Compile Time Polymorphism cont...
• An object representing a Rectangular Room will be created by using
constructor-1
• Room room1 = new Room(25.5, 20.0);
• An object representing a Square Room will be created by using
constructor-2
• Room room2 = new Room(25.0);

[PAGE 35]
Run Time Polymorphism
• Method Signature = Method_Name + Parameter_List
• Method Overriding:
• A method defined in the subclass has the same name signature as like
superclass, then the subclass method overrides (hides/supersedes)
the definition of the superclass method.
• C++ and C# languages are using Virtual Functions that are same as
overridden method in Java.

[PAGE 36]
Run Time Polymorphism cont...
• Rules for Overriding Methods:
• The method name and the order of arguments should be identical to
that of the superclass method.
• The return type of both the methods must be the same.
• The overriding method cannot be less accessible than the method it
overrides.
• For example: If the method override is declared as public in the
superclass cannot override it with the private keyword in the
subclass.
• An overriding method cannot raise more exceptions than those raised
by the method of the superclass (Exception and Errors are raised at
runtime).

[PAGE 37]
Run Time Polymorphism cont...
• Process of Overriding Methods:
• class Chair
• {
• public void adjustHeight()
• {
• System.out.println(“Adjusting Chair Height”);
• }
• }
• public class WheelChair extends Chair {
• public void adjustHeight() // override
• {
• System.out.println(“Adjusting WheelChair Height”);
• }
• public static void main(String[] a) {
• WheelChair wchair = new WheelChair();
• wchair.adjustHeight(); // calling method
• } }

[PAGE 38]
Run Time Polymorphism cont...
• Process of Overriding Methods:
• When we call the method “adjustHeight()”, the compiler searches for the
method in the current class (WheelChair) first.
• If it is not available in the current class then the compiler searches for the
method in the superclass.
•
