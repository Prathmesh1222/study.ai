[SLIDE 2]
Flow of Control
Java executes one statement after the other in the order they are written
Many Java statements are flow control statements: Alternation:	if, if else, switch
Looping: Escapes:
for, while, do while break, continue, return

[SLIDE 3]
If – The Conditional Statement
The if statement evaluates an expression and if that evaluation is true then the specified action is taken
if ( x < 10 ) x = 10;
If the value of x is less than 10, make x equal to 10
It could have been written:
if ( x < 10 ) x = 10;
Or, alternatively:
if ( x < 10 ) { x = 10; }

[SLIDE 4]
If… else Statement
The if … else statement evaluates an expression and performs 	one action if that evaluation is true or a different action if it is 	false.
if (x != oldx) {
System.out.print(“x was changed”);
}
else	{
System.out.print(“x is unchanged”);
}

[SLIDE 5]
Nested if … else
if (	myVal >	100 ) {
if (	remainderOn == true) { myVal = mVal % 100;
}
else	{
myVal = myVal / 100.0;
}
}
else
{
System.out.print(“myVal is in range”);
}

[SLIDE 6]
else if
Useful for choosing between alternatives:
}
else	{
// if all previous	tests have failed, execute code	block #3
}

[SLIDE 7]
The switch Statement
switch ( n ) { case 1:
// execute code block #1 break;
break; default:
// if all previous tests fail then
//execute code block #4
break;
}

[SLIDE 8]
The for loop
Loop n times
for ( i = 0; i < n; i++ ) {
// this code body will execute n	times
// ifrom	0	to n-1
}
Nested for:
for ( j = 0; j < 10; j++ ) { for ( i = 0; i < 20; i++ ){
// this code body will execute 200 times
}
}

[SLIDE 9]
while loops
while(response == 1) { System.out.print( “ID =” + userID[n]); n++;
response =	readInt( “Enter “);
}

[SLIDE 10]
do {… } while loops
do {
System.out.print( “ID =” + userID[n] ); n++;
response =	readInt( “Enter ” );
}while (response == 1);

[SLIDE 11]
Break
A break statement causes an	exit from the innermost containing while, do, for or switch statement.
for ( int i = 0; i < maxID, i++ ) { if ( userID[i] == targetID ) { index = i;
break;
}
} // program jumps here after break

[SLIDE 12]
Continue
Can only be used with while, do or for.
The continue statement causes the innermost loop to start the next iteration immediately
for ( int i	= 0; i <	maxID; i++ ) { if (	userID[i] != -1 ) continue;
System.out.print( “UserID ” + i	+ “ :” + userID);
}

[SLIDE 13]
Arrays
myArray has room for 8 elements
the elements are accessed by their index
in Java, array indices start at 0
An array is a collection of similar items
An array has a fixed:
name
type
length
These must be declared when the array is created.
Arrays sizes cannot be changed during the execution of the code
myArray =
0	1	2	3	4	5
6
7

[SLIDE 14]
Declaring Arrays
int myArray[];
declares myArray to be an array of integers myArray = new int[8];
sets up 8 integer-sized spaces in memory, labelled
myArray[0] to myArray[7]
int myArray[] = new int[8];
combines the two statements in one line

[SLIDE 15]
Assigning Values
refer to the array elements by index to store values in them. 	myArray[0] = 3;
myArray[1] = 6; myArray[2] = 3;	...
can create and initialise in one step:
int myArray[] = {3, 6, 3, 1, 6, 3, 4, 1};
Iterating Through Arrays
for loops are useful when dealing with arrays:
for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) { myArray[i] = getsomevalue();
}

[SLIDE 16]
Multi Dimensional Array
Two dimensional array:
data_type[][] array_name	= new	data_type[x][y];
For	example:
int[][] arr =	new	int[10][20]; or
Int	arr[][]=	new	int[10][20];
Three dimensional array:
int[][][] threeD_arr = new int[10][20][30];

[SLIDE 17]
Declaring the Array
1. Declare the array
private Student studentList[];
–	this declares studentList
2 .Create the array
studentList = new Student[10];
–	this sets up 10 spaces in memory that can hold references to Student objects
3. Create Student objects and add them to the array:
studentList[0] = new Student("Cathy", "Computing");
